Streams are objects used to collect and pass time series data from the client system into namespaces in OCS. You create and manage streams on this page.

## Search

To create a stream, you must first create a type. The type defines the structure of the data you want to stream into a selected namespace.

* To create a new stream, click **Streams** in the **Storage Explorer** pane, and then click **Add Stream**.

* To set permissions for a stream, select an existing stream, or hold down the **Ctrl** key and select multiple streams, and then click **Manage Permissions**.

* To edit a stream, select an existing stream, and then click **Edit Stream**.
