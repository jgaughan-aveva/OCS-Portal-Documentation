# Types

You create and manage types on this page. You first create a type in order to create a stream. The type defines the structure of the data you want to stream into a namespace.

**Search**

Type the name of any known type in the **Search** window to retrieve an existing type.

* To create a new type, click **Types** in the **Storage Explorer** pane, and then click **Add Type**.        

* To manage permissions for a selected type, select an existing type, or hold down the **Ctrl** key and select multiple types, and then click **Manage Permissions**.      

**Note:** You cannot edit an existing type. In order to have a type with different properties than originally assigned, you must create a new type. 

* To delete a type, select an existing type and click **Remove Type** to delete.
