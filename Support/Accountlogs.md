# Tenant logs

Logs allow you to see messages that are generated from any tenant related activity, errors that occurred, or any system messages that are generated. By default, you are presented with all the logs for the last one hour. If the log message is too long to fit on a table row, click on the row to expand it to display all of its contents.

## Filter Logs

To filter the logs, click **Filter Logs** in the toolbar. You will be presented with a dialog where you can specify the **Time Range**, **Service(s)**, and **Severity Level(s)**. Note that if no log types are selected, you will be shown all log types.

## Logs Statistics

To view service and severity level statistics, click **Stats** in the toolbar. You will be presented with a dialog where you can select either **Severity Level** or **Service** to view respective statistics.
