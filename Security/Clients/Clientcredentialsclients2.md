# Client-credentials clients

Client-credentials clients are used for server to server communication where no user interaction is required. The client typically has to authenticate with the token endpoint using its client ID and secret. A secret is a unique key generated for each client, to connect to OCS for a limited period of time. Clients typically use two secrets so they can
swap before one expires.
