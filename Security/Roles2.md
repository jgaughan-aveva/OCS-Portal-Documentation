# Roles

Roles are used to manage access within OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS).

Five roles are predefined for each tenant. The permissions associated with each user role are as follows:

**Account Administrator**                                      

Add, edit, remove, and edit the permissions of existing users.

**Account Contributor**                                        

Currently, this role does not yet grant the user any inherent
privileges; it is reserved for future use as new OCS features are introduced.                                                

**Account Data Steward**                                       

Currently, this role does not yet grant the user any inherent  privileges; it is reserved for future use as new OCS features  are introduced.                                                

**Account Viewer**           

Currently, this role does not yet grant the user any inherent  
privileges; it is reserved for future use as new OCS features are introduced.                                                

**Account Member** 

Log in and access the OCS portal. Users may be assigned one or more user roles, but all users are assigned the Account Member role.                                                          

To add a new tenant role, click **Add Role** and complete the requested information in the **Add Role** window.

To manage which users are assigned a role, click **Manage Users**.
