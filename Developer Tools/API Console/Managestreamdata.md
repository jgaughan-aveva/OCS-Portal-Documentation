# Manage stream data

Manage Data enables you to query data for a stream, and then filter,
add, edit, or delete displayed events in the selected stream.

From the **Query Type** drop-down list, select **Last Value**, **First
Value**, or **Get Values**.

If you select the **Get Values** query type, you must make the following
entries:

* **Start Index** - the key of the type that defines the selected stream, for example, DateTime.

* **Count** - the number of events you would like to see starting at the **Start Index**

* **Reversed** - select **True** to see events before and up to the **Start Index**. Select **False** to deselect this option.

You can select **Add Event**, **Edit Event**, or **Remove Event** to filter selected query results.
