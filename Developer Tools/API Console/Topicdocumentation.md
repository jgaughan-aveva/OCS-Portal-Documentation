# Topic documentation

A topic is used to aggregate data received from clients and make it available for consumption through a subscription. A new topic requires at least one client ID. Clients can be added to or removed from an existing topic, although a single client can only be mapped to one topic per namespace. When a topic is created, the mapped clients route data to
a special buffered queue, where it can be consumed by a subscription.

**Note:** Any subscription you create must contain both the tenantid and namespaceid referenced in its route. For example, if you entered the route \"PUT .../tenants/myTenantId/namespaces/myNamespaceId\", the subscription must have a tenantId of \"myTenantId\" and a namespace of
\"myNamespaceId\".
