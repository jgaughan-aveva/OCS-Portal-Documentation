# Data views

You create a data view by defining the target namespace, the source stream or streams, the desired data fields, time period, and interpolation interval. The ability to create data views in the portal will mesh directly with OSIsoft's Data Science Enablement efforts, whereby users will be able to programmatically access Data View content via an API for the purposes of advanced analytics.

## Create a data view

To create a new data view, complete the following:

1. Click Add Data View in the Data Views pane.
2. Enter the data view Name and Description in the Data View Information pane.
3. Click Standard or Narrow to specify the general shape of the data display.
4. Click the Add Query button in the Query Explorer pane.
5. In the Query ID pane, enter a name for the query in the Query ID field, or accept the default name. 
6. In the Query Type area, select Streams or Assets to indicate which this query is intended to search.
7. Type a portion of the name of any known stream or asset (preceded/followed by the * wildcard symbol). 
8. When the query results populate, click the Items per Page droplist and select the number of query result items to display per page.
  **Note**: Click on any query result item to display its data item details in the Data Item Details pane.
9. Click Save. The Configure Data View page displays.

## Configure a data view

To configure a data view, complete the following:

1. Type a friendly name in the Name field (or accept the system generated identifier).
2. Enter a description in the Description field (optional).
3. In the Index Configuration pane, select the date and time for the Start Index and End Index to specify the time period of the data to be included in the data view.
4. Enter a value in the Time Interval field to specify the time interval for your data.  The Time Interval field provides entry spaces for Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds. 
5. In the Field Management pane, select the data fields you want to include in the data display.  Use the Up and Down Arrows to move a selected data item up or down in the display.
6. Select a field to group the data fields, and use the Up Arrow to move it to the top of the list in the Field Management pane. Click the Group By icon.
